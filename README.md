# FPS-Shooter-Practice
Doing random stuff with unity3D
Stuff Done:-
  Initialized a first person player script with movement and rotation
  Lighting the environment with point lights and tried baking lightmaps with low samples
  Shooting script for the player that destroys the enemy object without any animation
  Sucessfully failed at creating a custom physics script for rigidbody game objects

Stuff that i might try implementing:-
  Initializing multiplayer in the created environment
  Try to deimplement Realtime lighting an create realistic samples with Baked lighting
  Use Standard assets rather than creating low poly shitty 3d models
